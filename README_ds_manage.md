- Type: Practical Course (Lab)
- Module: IN2106
- SWS: 6
- ECTS Credits: 10
- Prerequisites: This course requires good knowledge of distributed systems and experience with network programming. Therefore the following technical skills are required:
	- Programming knowledge with C/C++ or Rust
	- Experience with network programming
	- Familiarity with containers
- TUM Online: We will enroll you before the lab starts. Do not forget to register in the matching system to obtain a seat in the lab!

## Content

This course provides the opportunity to challenge and extend your knowledge in the area of distributed systems. In that context, the students will get involved in the management of the Cloud Systems Engineering course.

In more detail the Cloud Systems Engineering course covers the following topics: Containers, Cluster orchestration, Cloud storage, Distributed storage system, Replication protocols and Distributed transactions. For each topic, the students will create and manage an extensive set of exercises along with the respective test-cases. Furthermore, the students will communicate with the students of the Cloud Systems Engineering course, in order to provide help with any questions or issues related to the exercises.  At last, students will get hands-on experience with a fully automated DevOps system for continuous integration and testing of the assignments. 

## Registration info

- **Capacity:** We plan to have at most 12 places in this course.
- **Important note:** Formal registration for this course is performed via TUM Matching System.
- **Registration deadline:** Two weeks after the matching period, we will   formally register you in the course. If you want to drop out, please inform   us before the registration deadline.  

## Previous knowledge expected

This course requires good knowledge of distributed systems and experience with network programming. Therefore the following technical skills are required:	
- Programming knowledge with C/C++ or Rust
- Experience with network programming
- Familiarity with containers


Some of the courses, which provide a good background are:
- IN0010: Introduction to Computer Networking and Distributed Systems
- IN2259: Distributed Systems 
- IN2258: Middleware and Distributed Systems
- Cloud Systems Engineering (IN0012, IN2106, IN2128)
- Advanced Systems Programming in C/Rust (IN0012, IN2106, IN2128)
- Praktikum: Systems Programming in C++

In case of doubt, please contact the instructors with necessary background information.

## Objectives

- Deeper knowledge of distributed systems concepts
- Hands-on experience in a cloud infrastructure
- Experience in CI/CD
- Tutor experience

## Teaching and learning method

This course will let students get a better insight for several concepts in distributed systems. For each of this courseâ€™s topics the students will have the responsibility of understanding and explaining the necessary theoretical background. In addition, they will need to resolve issues and answer challenging questions raised by other students. In the technical part, students will design extensive exercises along with the respective test-cases and maintain an automated environment for continuous integration and testing.
